## Instacart-Shopper
This challenge is broken into two parts. The first part is implementing the public-facing site that a prospective Instacart Shopper would see when hearing about the opportunities that Instacart offers. The second is writing analytics to monitor the progress of shoppers through the hiring funnel.

## Technologies
